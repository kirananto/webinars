Anything that disrupts our daily routine brings an opportunity to reflect on our past, our present situation, and what possibilities we envision for the future. But reflection rarely leads to change without the action steps that teach us what is actually feasible and desirable. Herminia Ibarra will draw on two decades of research and writing on work and identity transition to describe key elements of successful career change, offering guidelines for taking advantage of these challenging times to do things we might not have done before.","tags":null,"url":"https://bit.ly/2yXUdX0"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"44"}}}
