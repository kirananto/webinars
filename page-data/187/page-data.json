Covid-19 has thrown our life into disarray and has us exploring newer means of reaching out to people. All of these solutions involve access to the internet. How do we implement these solutions in a country that has constantly been undermining access to a free and safe internet?\n\nIf we’re using the internet to stay connected, we also need to address the most fundamental problems with its infrastructure and distribution.
