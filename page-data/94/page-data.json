How best can civil society engage? What does inclusion and sustainability mean in the immediate and long-term futures? In order to safeguard the grassroots cultural and linguistic diversity of our countries and beyond borders, what are the pathways for the future? We know how much Heritage Matters, but how can we position heritage in all its manifestations in the holistic discourse of sustainable heritage development? How do we rethink the way we approach the UN Sustainable Development Goals? How do we continue to locate and advocate for culture in development through demonstration projects? These and many other questions and concerns will be addressed in this series of AnantU Webinars facilitated by the International Institute for the Inclusive Museum and the International Centre for Inclusive Cultural Leadership, AnantU.","tags":null,"url":"https://bit.ly/34L5ndh"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"94"}}}
