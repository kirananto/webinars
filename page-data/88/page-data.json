Or even better; what if the virtual tourists could control the movements of the local in real time? This is a virtual tour conducted by Faroe Islands every day. Just like a real-life computer game, you – the main player – will control the moves of the Faroese islander, who will not only explore locations on foot, but also take to the skies by helicopter, giving virtual visitors a bird’s eye perspective on our beautiful island nation’s steep grassy slopes, our 80,000 sheep and our unspoilt, wild and natural countryside.","tags":null,"url":"https://bit.ly/2xBniqS"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"88"}}}
